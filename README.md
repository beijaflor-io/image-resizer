# `image-resizer`
`image-resizer` is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) application that sits as a
custom origin to your CDN and will resize/optimise images on-the-fly. It is
Heroku ready, but can also be deployed easily to any cloud provider (has been
used with success on AWS).

The primary goal for this project was to abstract the need to set image
dimensions during the upload and storage phase of images in a modern web
application.
